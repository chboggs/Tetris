# Tetris

This is an iOS Tetris game I created during the summer of 2016, I had previously had it on github before a strange bug popped up and caused me to rewrite the project.

I created this by loosely using a guide as a reference in my exploring of iOS development and used the images/design from it.

Please give it a try and let me know of any issues, also if you see anything feel free to fork!
