# Tetris

This is an iOS Tetris game I created during the summer of 2016 and am currently adding to!

Images are found from a tetris guide I found online.

Please give it a try and let me know of any issues, also if you see anything feel free to fork!

## Current Issues
* Varying screen sizes make the game take up less of the iOS device
* Add high scores at least locally, maybe spin up a service eventually
* Add pausing and screen when game is opened
